        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This is based on a delicious, simple Carbonara recipe from my friend,
                Alex. With the addition of artichokes, it becomes a delightful way to
                enjoy veggies!
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb pasta (I like fettucine but whatever you like works!)</li>
                <li>5 egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 lb bacon</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 bunch parsley</li>
                <li>1 can artichoke hearts</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook the bacon as you wish.  One option is in the oven at
                    275 until it appears appropriately browned. Reserve about
                    half of the bacon grease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package.
                    Reserve some of the pasta water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare the sauce:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beat the egg yolks.</li>
                        <li>Stir in about 2 Tablespoons of Parmesan.</li>
                        <li>Add in the reserved bacon grease.</li>
                        <li>
                            Add enough pasta water for the sauce to seem appropriately
                            saucy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add in salt and/or pepper as you see fit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chop the artichoke hearts relatively finely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chop the parsley.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crumble the bacon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine the pasta and sauce, then add in the artichoke hearts,
                    most of the parsley, and bacon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve with the reserved parsley and additional Parmesan. Bon
                    appetit!!
                </li>
